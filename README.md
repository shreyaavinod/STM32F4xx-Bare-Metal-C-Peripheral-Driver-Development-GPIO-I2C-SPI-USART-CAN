# STM32F4xx Peripheral Driver Development (Bare-Metal C)

This project is a custom driver development framework for STM32F4xx microcontrollers using **bare-metal C**. It is built entirely from scratch without relying on STM32 HAL or LL libraries. The goal is to gain low-level control and deep understanding of how hardware peripherals work by programming directly with memory-mapped registers.

Currently, the project implements **GPIO** and **SPI DRIVERS**,and will be extended to include **I2C**, **USART**, and **CAN** drivers.
